# latex-master
My goto latex master template. Just in case overleaf goes down one day

## Diagrams 
 - For diagrams I like using mermaid.js diagrams. 
 - Go to https://workflow.jace.pro/ or any mermaid editor. 
 - Generate the code with whatever mode you want, open the svg page, and print it according to size you prefer
 - Import it into overleaf (The same way you insert images, no change).
